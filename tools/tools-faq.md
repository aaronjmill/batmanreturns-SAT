The `build_tools` and `converters` folders are intended to house custom scripts, utilities, and tools that assist in the build process and asset conversion for your Sega Saturn project. Here’s what you should consider filling them with:

### `build_tools` Folder

This folder should contain scripts and utilities that help automate or streamline various aspects of the build process. Here are some ideas:

1. **Asset Packaging Script**:
   - **`package_assets.py`** (or a similar script):
     - A Python script (or shell script) that automatically packages assets (graphics, audio, etc.) into a format that can be used by the game. For instance, it could compress or bundle textures, convert audio formats, or compile level data.

2. **ISO Generation Script**:
   - **`generate_iso.sh`**:
     - A shell script that wraps the `mkisofs` command (used in the Makefile) and adds additional steps if needed. For example, it might add a custom bootloader or perform additional validation before creating the ISO.

3. **Build Automation Script**:
   - **`build_all.sh`**:
     - A script that performs a full clean build, including all preprocessing steps, assembling, linking, and generating the final ISO. It could also handle versioning or tagging of builds.
   
4. **Build Configuration Tool**:
   - **`config_tool.py`**:
     - A script that allows you to easily switch between different build configurations, such as debug and release modes, or different platform targets if applicable.

5. **Custom Linker Tool**:
   - **`custom_linker_tool.py`**:
     - A tool to modify or generate linker scripts dynamically based on the project’s needs, such as adjusting memory maps or section allocations on the fly.

### `converters` Folder

This folder should contain tools that convert assets (graphics, audio, etc.) from their original formats into ones that are compatible with the Sega Saturn. Here are some examples:

1. **Graphics Converter**:
   - **`convert_graphics.py`**:
     - A script that converts PNG or BMP files into Saturn-compatible formats such as 4BPP (4 bits per pixel) or 8BPP textures. It might also handle palette generation and optimize images for the Saturn’s VDP1/VDP2 requirements.

2. **Audio Converter**:
   - **`convert_audio.py`**:
     - A script that converts WAV or MP3 files into the format used by the Saturn’s SCSP (Sound Control Signal Processor), such as 8-bit PCM or ADPCM, and ensures the audio is correctly looped and compressed.

3. **Tilemap Converter**:
   - **`convert_tilemaps.py`**:
     - A tool that converts level designs or tilemaps from a game design tool (e.g., Tiled) into a format that the Sega Saturn can render, including handling tile-based backgrounds and layers.

4. **Font Generator**:
   - **`generate_fonts.py`**:
     - A script that takes font files (e.g., TTF) and generates bitmap fonts that can be rendered on the Sega Saturn, taking into account the limited resolution and color depth.

5. **Palette Optimizer**:
   - **`optimize_palette.py`**:
     - A script that optimizes color palettes for the Saturn, ensuring that sprites and backgrounds share as many colors as possible to stay within CRAM (Color RAM) limits.

6. **Level Data Converter**:
   - **`convert_levels.py`**:
     - A script that takes level data from a modern format (like JSON or XML) and converts it into the binary format expected by the Sega Saturn game engine.

### Summary

- **`build_tools`**: Should contain scripts that assist in the automation of the build process, such as asset packaging, ISO generation, and build configuration.
- **`converters`**: Should house tools that convert assets into formats suitable for the Sega Saturn, including graphics, audio, tilemaps, and more.

Filling these folders with the appropriate tools and scripts will greatly streamline the development process, ensuring that assets are correctly formatted and that builds are consistent and reproducible.
